Using MoFA, AI agents can be constructed via templates and combined in layers to form more powerful Super Agents.\n\n## Why MoFA?\n\nBuilding AI agents with MoFA offers:\n\n1. **Modularity**: Modular agent templates and agent services; simple configurations with straightforward interfaces between modules.\n\n2. **Clarity**: A \"LEGO brick\"-style logic for assembling complex systems.\n\n3. **Composition**: Agentic applications gain greater capabilities and expand functionalities by putting composable agents together.\n\n4. **Simplicity**: Constructing complex agents becomes a zero-code process.\n\n5. **High Performance**: Agents operate in the high-performance, low-latency distributed AI and robotics computation environment of DORA-RS.\n\n6. **Diversity**: MoFA's agent composition combines capabilities organically, creating more powerful and comprehensive composite agents.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Nesting Design Patterns of AI Agents\n\nAI agents are intelligent software applications with various design patterns:\n\n- **LLM Inference**: Using large language models for basic inference\n- **Customized Prompt**: Tailoring system prompts for specific agents\n- **Reflection Pattern**: Agents capable of self-review and improvement\n- **Actor Pattern**: Agents with external tool and resource capabilities\n- **ReAct Pattern**: Combining reflection and tool usage\n- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agents working together\n\n### Agent Kernel Services\n\nMoFA provides core services to agents, including:\n- Memory management\n- Task planning\n- Knowledge base integration\n- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n- Action capabilities\n\n### Composition-Based Architecture\n\nComposition allows assembling elements into new entities without changing original components, enabling developers to build and recombine agents for new functionalities.\n\n### Dataflow-Driven Approach\n\nMoFA employs a dataflow-driven method focusing on data dependencies rather than business rules, simplifying and enhancing modularity.\n\n";
