Reasoner Pattern\nThe simplest pattern for building agents that can reason and respond to queries.\n\n### 2. Self-Refine Pattern  \nAgents that can review and improve their own outputs through iterative refinement.\n\n### 3. CrewAI Pattern\nMulti-agent collaboration pattern for complex task execution.\n\n## Pattern Categories\n\n- **Basic Patterns**: Single-agent designs for simple tasks\n- **Collaborative Patterns**: Multi-agent coordination\n- **Reflective Patterns**: Self-improving agents\n- **Service Patterns**: Specialized service agents\n\nThese patterns form the foundation for building more complex agent behaviors in the MoFA framework.\n";
