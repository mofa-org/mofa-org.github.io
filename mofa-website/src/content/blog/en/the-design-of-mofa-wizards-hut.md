## **Position Statement**

mofa.ai is the online home for wizards. mofa.ai provides every wizard with an exclusive webpage - the "MoFA Wizard's Hut".

## **Who Are the Wizards**

There are two conditions to become a wizard:

1. Be a MoFA developer, or
2. Be a MoFA community contributor

## **Design Philosophy**

The Wizard's Hut is designed as a personal showcase and collaboration space for MoFA community members. Each wizard gets:

- **Personal Profile**: Showcasing their contributions and projects
- **Agent Gallery**: Displaying agents they've built
- **Activity Timeline**: Tracking their journey in the MoFA ecosystem
- **Social Connections**: Connecting with fellow wizards

The design embraces the magical theme of MoFA - where developers are "wizards" who craft intelligent agents through code, bringing AI to life like magic spells.

## **Technical Implementation**

Built with modern web technologies, the Wizard's Hut features:
- Responsive design for all devices
- Real-time updates from GitHub contributions
- Integration with MoFA agent registry
- Community-driven customization options
