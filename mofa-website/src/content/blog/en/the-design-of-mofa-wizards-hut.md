## **Position Statement**

mofa.ai is the online home for wizards. mofa.ai provides every wizard with an exclusive webpage—the "Wizard's Hut" (mofa wizard's hut).

## **Who Are the Wizards**

There are two conditions to become a wizard:

1.

- Is a MoFA developer, or
- Is a MoFA application developer, or
- Is a Bounty Wizard project developer, or
- Is a completer or winner of the MoFA series hackathons, or
- Is a developer who uses MoFA to complete tasks, or
- Is a friend who makes various contributions (not limited to development) to MoFA.

2. Stars "🌟" the MoFA project on GitHub, identifying with and supporting the MoFA project.

Every wizard has their exclusive webpage on mofa.ai (Wizard's Hut).

## **Wizard ID**

Since wizards are all developers, we use the wizard's GitHub ID as the wizard ID, which serves as the "house number" for the Wizard's Hut.

## **Conceptual Design**

Fundamentally, the content in the Magic House will be directly related to the wizard and MoFA. This part needs to express:

- mofa.ai is grateful for every wizard's contribution to mofa.ai
- mofa.ai hopes that the wizards' contributions to mofa.ai will become their "medals" recognized by the world, endorsing the wizards and助力 their growth.

### **Wizard Information Hub**

Wizards can provide various social media connections and contact information in their Magic House. mofa.ai does not redundantly provide information already available on various social media. This information is provided by the wizards themselves. The information is maintained autonomously by the wizards. mofa.ai is not responsible for the authenticity or accuracy of the information.

### **Wizard's MoFA Resume**

Includes

- Contributions to MoFA on GitHub
- Bounty Hunter project completions
- Hackathon wins
- Achievements from using MoFA to complete other tasks
- MoFA-related repos
- Contributions to MoFA

Excludes

- Any resume information not directly related to MoFA. mofa.ai does not possess the authoritative qualifications to endorse other information.

Wizard mofa.ai-related resume information is maintained by the project's core development team.
