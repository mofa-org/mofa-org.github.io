We sincerely invite all developers interested in AI Agents to explore, build, and use the MoFA open-source project together, creating more powerful agents.

In the MoFA ecosystem, developers have a unique title: **"Wizards"**.

But not everyone can easily become a wizard. To truly master MoFA, you need to pass challenges and demonstrate your technical strength! You can start with simple tasks, gradually increase the difficulty, and eventually become an expert in驾驭 AI agents.

Once you become a "Wizard," you will have the opportunity to complete bounty tasks.
