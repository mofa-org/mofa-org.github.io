**From GPT-3 Assistant to DeepSeek Consultant, to the Future AI Superman**

DeepSeek's emergence has shaken the world. The world has long suffered from expensive computing power, technological monopolies, and closed-source AI. DeepSeek's appearance has undoubtedly broken these shackles.

We are equally excited but also more confused. For us, the most impactful aspect is not the technology itself, but experiencing DeepSeek's "deep thinking" capability firsthand. The R1 model's confident, unhurried, and organized reasoning ability not only means we no longer need complex prompt engineering to guide AI logical reasoning, but more importantly, AI can deeply understand user intent and provide rich, well-structured answers. This breakthrough elevates AI from being an "Assistant" to a "Senior Consultant," with knowledge, thinking ability, and even experience accumulation surpassing humans.

It's foreseeable that AI development won't stop here. After consultants, will it evolve into "Superman"?

With these questions, we asked DeepSeek about the relationship between AI and humanity. After 18 seconds of deep thinking, it generated a fascinating article. While AI's extensive references and ornate writing are no longer so novel, one sentence caught our eye: "Standing at the threshold of human-machine symbiosis, we need to reconsider the profound meaning of Heidegger's 'technology is the revealing of existence'." Thus, we began researching philosopher Martin Heidegger and his representative work *The Question Concerning Technology*.

*This article explores the philosophical implications of AI technology through the lens of Heidegger's philosophy, examining how AI reveals and shapes our understanding of humanity and existence.*
