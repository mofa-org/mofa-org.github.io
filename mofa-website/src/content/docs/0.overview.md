**MoFA: Modular Framework for Agents**

MoFA is a software framework for building AI agents through a composition-based approach. Using MoFA, AI agents can be constructed via templates and combined in layers to form more powerful Super Agents.

## Why MoFA?

Building AI agents with MoFA offers:

1. **Modularity**: Modular agent templates and agent services; simple configurations with straightforward interfaces between modules.

2. **Clarity**: A "LEGO brick"-style logic for assembling complex systems.

3. **Composition**: Agentic applications gain greater capabilities and expand functionalities by putting composable agents together.

4. **Simplicity**: Constructing complex agents becomes a zero-code process.

5. **High Performance**: Agents operate in the high-performance, low-latency distributed AI and robotics computation environment of DORA-RS.

6. **Diversity**: MoFA's agent composition combines capabilities organically, creating more powerful and comprehensive composite agents.

## Key Features

### Nesting Design Patterns of AI Agents

AI agents are intelligent software applications with various design patterns:

- **LLM Inference**: Using large language models for basic inference
- **Customized Prompt**: Tailoring system prompts for specific agents
- **Reflection Pattern**: Agents capable of self-review and improvement
- **Actor Pattern**: Agents with external tool and resource capabilities
- **ReAct Pattern**: Combining reflection and tool usage
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agents working together

### Agent Kernel Services

MoFA provides core services to agents, including:
- Memory management
- Task planning
- Knowledge base integration
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Action capabilities

### Composition-Based Architecture

Composition allows assembling elements into new entities without changing original components, enabling developers to build and recombine agents for new functionalities.

### Dataflow-Driven Approach

MoFA employs a dataflow-driven method focusing on data dependencies rather than business rules, simplifying and enhancing modularity.
