MoFA provides various design patterns that help developers build sophisticated agents with different capabilities and behaviors.

## Core Design Patterns

### 1. Reasoner Pattern
The simplest pattern for building agents that can reason and respond to queries.

### 2. Self-Refine Pattern
Agents that can review and improve their own outputs through iterative refinement.

### 3. CrewAI Pattern
Multi-agent collaboration pattern for complex task execution.

## Pattern Categories

- **Basic Patterns**: Single-agent designs for simple tasks
- **Collaborative Patterns**: Multi-agent coordination
- **Reflective Patterns**: Self-improving agents
- **Service Patterns**: Specialized service agents

These patterns form the foundation for building more complex agent behaviors in the MoFA framework.
