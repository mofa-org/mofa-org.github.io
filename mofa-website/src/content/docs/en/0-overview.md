MoFA is a software framework for building AI agents through composition-based approaches.


## MoFA Design Philosophy

MoFA is a software framework for building AI agents through composition. Using MoFA, AI agents can be built from templates and composed by stacking to form more powerful Super Agents.

MoFA's unique design philosophy includes:

- **Ordinary People Doing Extraordinary Things**: AI should not be the exclusive domain of elites and giants. MoFA enables everyone to harness and develop AI, turning the impossible into possible, allowing ordinary people to create the extraordinary.
- **Composition AI**: Inspired by Unix philosophy, MoFA takes "composition" as its core principle. You can build agents, connect agents, and integrate tools like building blocks, making AI simple, flexible, and powerful.
- **Everything Agent**: Unlike most software, in MoFA's world, agents are the applications of the AI era. Not just large language models, they can be code, scripts, APIs, or even MoFA itself. MoFA is not just a framework, but an agent ecosystem.
- **Data Flow**: While most agent frameworks rely on complex workflows, MoFA chooses a more intuitive and powerful data flow approach. This enables agents to be freely composed, decomposed, and reused.
